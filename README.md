# Week 8 Quiz

### Part 1

I intend to extend the ‘Wheels of Fortune’ artwork by Pacita Abad for the creative coding major project by incorporating animation. I find the pointillism imaging technique particularly suitable, especially La Baie (Saint-Tropez) by Paul Signac. His use of unblended strokes to illustrate the scenery creates a blurred effect from afar which can be further manipulated to reach the goal of animating the artwork. I intend to use this technique by illustrating larger shapes using small dots and creating motion by changing the colour of the dots and shifting it’s position.
